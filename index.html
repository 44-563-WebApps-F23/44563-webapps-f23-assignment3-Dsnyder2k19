    <h3> Favorite Vacation Spot: New Orleans, Louisiana</h3>
    <p>
        I love the atmosphere of New Orleans. A few of my favorite foods
        are there such as <b>gumbo, jumbalaya, and bread pudding.</b> The seafood
        there is super fresh, so I loved trying and fish dishes too. The city
        was fun to explore and its filled with so much history. I went on a 
        <b>riverboat tour and a cajun river ride</b>, both were equally fun.
