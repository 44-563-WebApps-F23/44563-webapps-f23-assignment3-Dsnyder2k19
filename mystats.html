            I think one of the most interesting facts about myself is 
            that I was an uncle before I was born.

        <h2>Favorite Food: Gumbo</h2>
        <p>
            My favorite food is gumbo. I first learned about gumbo on my first 
            trip to New Orleans. There are a few variations to the food where
            you can have chicken, andoulie sausage, and/or shrimp. All of these
            together enhances the flavor of the dish. The soup or roux, is cooked
            for around 2-3 hours, letting many different flavors sink it to improve
            the dish even more.
